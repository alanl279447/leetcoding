//    https://leetcode.com/problems/can-i-win/
//    Input: maxChoosableInteger = 10, desiredTotal = 11
//    Output: false
//    Explanation:
//    No matter which integer the first player choose, the first player will lose.
//    The first player can choose an integer from 1 up to 10.
//    If the first player choose 1, the second player can only choose integers from 2 up to 10.
//    The second player will win by choosing 10 and get a total = 11, which is >= desiredTotal.
//    Same with other integers chosen by the first player, the second player will always win.
